- title: "GutGenome Intelligence: LLM-Powered Microbiome Diagnostic System"
  description: "Developed a sophisticated LLM pipeline that transforms raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing data into clinically-grounded veterinary diagnostic reports. The system leverages Google's Gemini LLM to interpret complex taxonomic profiles, providing automated analysis of dysbiosis scores, functional pathways (such as SCFA and LPS activity), and neuroinflammatory markers. It delivers actionable health insights, including dietary sensitivity predictions and FMT suitability assessments, bridging the gap between raw genomic data and clinical decision-making."
