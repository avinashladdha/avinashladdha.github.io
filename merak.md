# Merak
## Coming soon...

Merak is a Serbian word. One of the most beautiful words not directly translated to English.
It means felling of bliss from simplest of pleasures. It is the pursuit of small, daily pleasures that add up to a great sense of happiness and fulfillment. This newsletter is a small effort in the direction of finding joy in small learnings everyday.
Published fortnightly.
