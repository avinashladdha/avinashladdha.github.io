# Hello, I am Avinash.

I am a philomath and bibliophile. The range of my interests had me working from a novel glucose (it powers your body!) measuring device to doing a research assistantship in finance. Having explored and enjoyed diverse fields during engineering, I have found that data contains hidden answers to a lot of interesting problems. Until I make a billion dollars or find a more unifying field to work in, my work and research are devoted to data sciences!

I have worked with non-profits in the past and look forward to solving data problems with them. Also reach out for collaborative research.
